```

This pseudocode outlines the high-level steps and considerations for building the described web application. Each step would need to be further detailed and implemented using actual code. The actual implementation would involve writing JavaScript, React components, Node.js server logic, Solidity contracts, and corresponding tests

Given the complexity of the Global Regeneration Plan and the need to start with a manageable scope, let's begin by creating the core of the web application using React and an interactive map. We'll use `react-simple-maps` for its simplicity and integration capabilities, as suggested by Source 0, and `react-leaflet` for its direct DOM manipulation capabilities for efficient map updates, as mentioned in Source 1.

Let's write the initial code for setting up the interactive map in React, which will be the foundation for implementing the Global Regeneration Plan's web application features.

```jsx
// Install the necessary libraries
// npm install react-simple-maps react-leaflet leaflet

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ComposableMap, Geographies, Geography } from 'react-simple-maps';
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet';
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';

const geoUrl =
 "YOUR_TOPOJSON_URL_HERE"; // Replace with the URL to your topojson file for the map

const MapChart = () => {
 return (
    <ComposableMap>
      <Geographies geography={geoUrl}>
        {({ geographies }) =>
          geographies.map(geo => (
            <Geography key={geo.rsmKey} geography={geo} />
          ))
        }
      </Geographies>
    </ComposableMap>
 );
};

const InteractiveMap = () => {
 const [activeLocation, setActiveLocation] = useState(null);

 return (
    <MapContainer center={[51.505, -0.09]} zoom={13} style={{ height: "100vh", width: "100vw" }}>
      <TileLayer
        url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
      />
      {/* Placeholder for markers */}
      {/* Example Marker */}
      <Marker position={[51.505, -0.09]} onClick={() => setActiveLocation("Example Location")}>
        <Popup>
          A pretty CSS3 popup. <br /> Easily customizable.
        </Popup>
      </Marker>
    </MapContainer>
 );
};

const App = () => {
 return (
    <div>
      <MapChart />
      <InteractiveMap />
    </div>
 );
};

export default App;
```

In the above example:

- We set up a basic map with `react-simple-maps` using a topojson file that defines the geographies.
- We also set up an interactive map with `react-leaflet` where you can add markers and popups.
- `activeLocation` state is used to manage the state of the active location, which can be tied to user interactions later on.
- Replace `"YOUR_TOPOJSON_URL_HERE"` with the actual URL to your topojson file.

This code provides a starting point for the web application. We'll need to build upon this by adding the ORM, PAV, and IAC functionality, user authentication, rewards distribution, and other features as outlined in the project plan. 

As we progress, we'll incrementally integrate the backend logic, user interface components, and other necessary functionalities to fully implement the Global Regeneration Plan.

## add protocols ORM, PAV and IAC
To integrate the ORM, PAV, and IAC functionality into the web application, we'll need to create components for each protocol and handle user interactions and data exchange with the server. 

Here's a simplified example of how the React components for the ORM, PAV, and IAC functionalities could look:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

// ORM Component
const ORMForm = () => {
 const [speciesName, setSpeciesName] = useState('');
 const [photo, setPhoto] = useState(null);
 const [areaDescription, setAreaDescription] = useState('');
 const [location, setLocation] = useState([0, 0]);

 const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('speciesName', speciesName);
    formData.append('photo', photo);
    formData.append('areaDescription', areaDescription);
    formData.append('location', JSON.stringify(location));

    await axios.post('/api/observations', formData);
 };

 return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={speciesName} onChange={(e) => setSpeciesName(e.target.value)} placeholder="Species Name" required />
      <input type="file" onChange={(e) => setPhoto(e.target.files[0])} required />
      <textarea value={areaDescription} onChange={(e) => setAreaDescription(e.target.value)} placeholder="Area Description" required />
      <input type="number" value={location[0]} onChange={(e) => setLocation([e.target.value, location[1]])} placeholder="Longitude" required />
      <input type="number" value={location[1]} onChange={(e) => setLocation([location[0], e.target.value])} placeholder="Latitude" required />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
 );
};

// PAV Component
const PAVList = ({ locations }) => {
 return (
    <ul>
      {locations.map((location) => (
        <li key={location.id}>
          <button onClick={() => axios.put(`/api/locations/${location.id}/verify`, { verified: true })}>Verify</button>
          {location.name}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
 );
};

// IAC Component
const IACForm = () => {
 const [interventionId, setInterventionId] = useState('');
 const [photos, setPhotos] = useState([]);
 const [workDone, setWorkDone] = useState('');

 const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('photos', photos);
    formData.append('workDone', workDone);

    await axios.put(`/api/interventions/${interventionId}`, formData);
 };

 return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <select value={interventionId} onChange={(e) => setInterventionId(e.target.value)} required>
        <option value="">Select Intervention</option>
        {/* Options populated dynamically based on available interventions */}
      </select>
      <input type="file" onChange={(e) => setPhotos(e.target.files)} required />
      <input type="number" value={workDone} onChange={(e) => setWorkDone(e.target.value)} placeholder="Work Done (%)" required />
      <button type="submit">Confirm</button>
    </form>
 );
};

export { ORMForm, PAVList, IACForm };
```

In the above example:

- The `ORMForm` component handles the ORM protocol's observation and registration steps. It sends a POST request to the `/api/observations` endpoint on form submission.
- The `PAVList` component displays a list of registered locations retrieved from the server. Each location has a "Verify" button that sends a PUT request to the `/api/locations/:id/verify` endpoint.
- The `IACForm` component handles the IAC protocol's enrollment and confirmation steps. It sends a PUT request to the `/api/interventions/:id` endpoint on form submission.

These are simplified examples and don't include form validation, error handling, or the other parts of the ORM, PAV, and IAC functionalities. However, they give an idea of how to structure the React components and how to send requests to the backend server.

Remember to replace `'/api/observations'`, `'/api/locations/:id/verify'`, and `'/api/interventions/:id'` with the actual endpoints for storing observations, verifying locations, and confirming interventions in your backend server. Also, ensure that the server is set up to handle multipart/form-data requests if you're sending files like photos.

As you progress, you'll need to expand on these examples to include the other functionalities and to handle user authentication, data verification, and reward distribution.
